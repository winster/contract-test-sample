### Spring Cloud Contract based AMQP application
This application is created as simple as possible. It uses spring-cloud-contract to verify the message contract at publisher and consumer side
### What does the application contain
1. A Producer application to publish a message to amqp
2. A Consumer application to receive the message

### Spring cloud contract integration
#### On Producer side
1. Producer contains the contract definition (under test/resources/contracts)
2. BaseTest class for contract tests publish message to Amqp
3. ContractVerifierTest (auto generated) will verify the contract
#### On Consumer side
1. Consumer downloads the stubs from local repo
2. The only test will trigger the stub using label
3. Asserts the contract

### Additional points to notice
1. If `spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp` is used instead of `spring-boot-starter-amqp`, you need to disable `stream` as follows to get rid of the error
``` No bean named '<your-exchange-name>' available```
```
stubrunner.stream.enabled=false
```
2. If `opentracing-spring-jaeger-cloud-starter` or any similar tracing is on classpath, you need to disable them as follows to get rid of the error
``` StubRunner AMQP will work only if RabbiTemplate is a spy```
```
opentracing.spring.rabbitmq.enabled=false
```
